# Calculator Application

A simple calculator application built using Java Swing and AWT that supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. The application provides a user-friendly interface for performing multiple operations in a sequence.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a graphical calculator application that allows users to input numbers and perform various arithmetic operations in a straightforward manner. The calculator is designed to handle multiple consecutive operations, such as `8 + 1 - 3 * 5 / 2`, and display the result once the "=" button is pressed.

## Key Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and modulus (`%`).
- **Multiple Operations Handling:** The calculator can perform multiple operations in sequence.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and simple GUI built using Java Swing and AWT.
- **Delete and Clear Functionality:** The "Dlt" button allows the user to delete the last character, and the "Clr" button clears the entire input.
- **Decimal Point Support:** Allows the user to include decimals in calculations.

## Key Concepts Used

- **Java Swing:** Utilized for building the graphical user interface, including buttons, text fields, and panels.
- **Java AWT:** Provides basic GUI functionalities and event handling.
- **Event Handling:** Implements the `ActionListener` interface to handle button clicks and perform corresponding actions.
- **String Manipulation:** Used for managing and evaluating mathematical expressions entered by the user.
- **Expression Evaluation:** A basic method to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions based on operator precedence.
